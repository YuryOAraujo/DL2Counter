# DL2Counter
The Dying Light 2 inspired counter, made using HTML, CSS and Javascript, is a simple tool designed with a sleek and minimalist aesthetic. It allows you to increment or decrement the value by clicking the plus or minus buttons, respectively. The value is prominently displayed in a large font, and when the value is greater than 0, it turns red to provide a visual cue. The counter also features a clear button to reset the value. The counter's state is saved locally, so you can always continue where you left off even after closing the page.
